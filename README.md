## 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fake news using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to automatically classify news articles as **fake** or **real**, helping to combat the spread of misinformation across digital platforms.

### 🚀 Features

* Clean and preprocess news text data
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF
* Model training with classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM
* Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
* Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and experimentation

### 📂 Dataset

We use publicly available datasets like:

* [Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset)
* LIAR dataset

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas, NumPy
* NLTK / SpaCy
* Jupyter Notebook

### 📌 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

### ✅ Results

Achieved up to **90%+ accuracy** on test data using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF features.
